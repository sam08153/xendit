# Food Delivery App - Backend Take Home Test

This repository contains a take-home test for backend developers to demonstrate their skills by implementing new features for a food delivery application built with Node.js and TypeScript.

## Project Overview

This is a backend API for a food delivery application that allows:
- Customers to browse restaurants, order food, track deliveries, and make payments
- Restaurant owners to manage their profiles, menus, and orders
- Delivery personnel to update delivery status and location
- Administrators to oversee the entire system

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local or using Docker)

### Installation

#### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start MongoDB using Docker:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
5. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

#### Option 2: Local MongoDB
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Make sure MongoDB is installed and running locally
4. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
5. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
